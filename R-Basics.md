# What is `R`

As found on the [project's website](http://cran.us.r-project.org/):  


>  R is ‘GNU S’, a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques: linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, etc.  
  
  
I like to think of `R` as a 

>  Statistical programming language  

In that you can:

-  manipulate the file system  
-  interface with modern Web APIs  
-  read/write data to most contemporary database formats  
-  and oh by the way, you can automate statistical analyses and reports


## Basic functionality

At it's simplest form, `R` is just a calculator


```r
2+2
```

```
[1] 4
```

```r
5 / 3
```

```
[1] 1.667
```

```r
5 ** 2
```

```
[1] 25
```

```r
5 ^ 2
```

```
[1] 25
```


But it's so much more than that
