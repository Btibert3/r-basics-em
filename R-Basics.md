# What is `R`

As found on the [project's website](http://cran.us.r-project.org/):  


>  R is ‘GNU S’, a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques: linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, etc.
  
  
  
At it's simplest form, `R` is just a calculator


```r
2+2
```

```
[1] 4
```
